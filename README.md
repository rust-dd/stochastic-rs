# stochastic-rs

**stochastic-rs** is a high-performance Rust library for simulating and analyzing stochastic processes. Designed for applications in quantitative finance, AI training, and statistical modeling, it provides efficient tools to generate synthetic data and analyze complex stochastic systems.

## OpenAPI for Data Generation

An OpenAPI interface is available to generate stochastic data on the fly. This feature is experimental and continuously expanding.

**API Documentation:** [https://stochastic-api-production.up.railway.app/](https://stochastic-api-production.up.railway.app/)

## Installation

Add **stochastic-rs** to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
stochastic-rs = "0.x.0"
```

Ensure you have Rust installed. Visit [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for setup instructions.
